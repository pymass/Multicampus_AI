The unary ~ (invert) operator yields the bitwise inversion of its integer argument. The bitwise inversion of x is defined as -(x+1). It only applies to integral numbers.

a = 1
a1 = ~a
a2 = 2
a3 = ~a2
print(bin(a))
print(bin(a1))
print(bin(a2))
print(bin(a3))


import numpy as np
a3 = np.array([1,2,3,4])
print(~np.amin(a3))
